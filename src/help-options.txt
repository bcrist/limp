Options:
  -R, --recursive       Search input directories recursively for files
                        matching the input filenames.

  -n, --dry-run         Make no changes, but report which files would be
                        changed if run without this option.

  -x, --extensions EXT  Specifies a comma-separated list of file extensions.
                        When searching a directory, only files having one of
                        these extensions will be processed.  If not specified,
                        all extensions associated with a language are checked.
                        Extensions are case-insensitive, except when longer
                        than 128 bytes.

  -b, --break-on-fail   Stop processing additional inputs after the first
                        failure.

  --depfile PATH        Outputs included scripts and templates to a `gcc -MMD`
                        style dependency file.

  --set KEY VALUE       Assigns a global string before processing each input
                        file.

  --eval STRING         Evaluates the provided string before processing each
                        input file.

  --test                Ignores other options, outputs nothing, and exits.

  -v, --verbose         Log more information about files being processed.

  -q, --quiet           Only log errors.

  -V, --version         Prints version information.

  -?, --help            Prints this help message.  --help provides more
                        detailed information.

  --                    Stops processing options.  All remaining args will be
                        considered input filename patterns, even if they start
                        with '-'.
